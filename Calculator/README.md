# The reason behind this

The calculator is my first ever "finished" product that incorporates JS with HTML/CSS. 
I have used it to start my journey in learning JavaScript and for a first website, it's not that bad?

Sure, things could have been done in so many better ways, my whole project is worthy of being called bad code, but that's besides the point... this project is a very good representation of how I improved as well :)

I don't plan on updating this particular project anymore, no matter the bugs.
