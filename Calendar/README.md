# The reason behind this

The calendar is my second project (third in order of making) that I have gotten to a point with that I can call it """"done"""". While the project is currently FAR from done, it is a start at the very least.

The goal of this app is to learn how to use LocalStorage and Cookies alongside using templates to generate items dynamically and also make everything into a PWA in the end :)

I will probably make a video documenting everything that is going inside here in order to explain it for other JS newbs that feel overwhelmed by the amount of bad code there is here. ( I swear everything makes sense to me )
